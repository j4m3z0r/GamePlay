- fakeal contains OpenAL headers and a simple stub file containing dummy
  implementations for the handful of OpenAL methods that get called.
- fakeogg contains a single header file that is necessary to get types right
  for the Ogg Vorbis library (which is included practically everywhere).
- Other directories are straight copies of the libraries they are named after.
